print(5 - 6)
# 8 / 2
print(8/2)
# Question 5:

# The program should then ask the user for three numbers (floats) and print the following:
inputNum1 = float(input())
inputNum2 = float(input())
inputNum3 = float(input())

# 1. The sum of the three numbers is <sum>

# 2. The product of the three numbers is <product>

# 3. round the three numbers to the nearest integer and print the sum of the three rounded numbers divided by 3

# 4. The average of the three numbers is <average>

# Question 7: Ask the user for an input of a symbol (in the example its *)
